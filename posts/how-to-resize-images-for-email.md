# How to Resize Images for Email Attachments

Trying to send photos via email but hitting attachment size limits? Here's everything you need to know about resizing images for email.

## Why Resize Images for Email?

Email providers have strict attachment size limits:

- **Gmail**: 25 MB total
- **Outlook**: 20 MB total
- **Yahoo**: 25 MB total
- **Apple Mail**: Varies by provider

A single photo from a modern smartphone can be 3-5 MB or more. Send a few photos and you'll quickly hit these limits.

## The Solution: Resize Before Sending

By resizing your images, you can:
- Send more photos in one email
- Faster upload and download times
- Better experience for recipients on mobile
- Avoid bounced emails due to size limits

## Recommended Sizes for Email

### For Viewing in Email
- **Width**: 600-800 pixels
- **Quality**: 70-80%
- **Format**: JPG

### For Printing by Recipient
- **Width**: 1920-2560 pixels
- **Quality**: 85-90%
- **Format**: JPG

### For Thumbnails/Previews
- **Width**: 300-400 pixels
- **Quality**: 70%
- **Format**: JPG

## Batch Resizing Multiple Photos

Need to send an album of photos? Here's the workflow:

1. Upload all photos at once
2. Set consistent dimensions (e.g., 800px width)
3. Choose JPG format
4. Set quality to 75%
5. Click resize - all images download automatically

## Example File Size Reductions

| Original | After Resizing | Savings |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| 5 MB (4000x3000) | 150 KB (800x600) | 97% |
| 3 MB (3264x2448) | 120 KB (800x600) | 96% |
| 8 MB (6000x4000) | 200 KB (800x533) | 97.5% |

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Resize to 800px width for email viewing  
✅ Use 70-75% quality for email  
✅ Convert to JPG format  
✅ Resize all images in a batch  
✅ Keep originals backed up separately  

### DON'T:
❌ Send original camera photos via email  
❌ Use PNG for photos (much larger)  
❌ Set quality below 60% (too blurry)  
❌ Resize only width without maintaining ratio  
❌ Forget to check total attachment size  

## Special Cases

### Sending Photos for Printing
If recipients want to print your photos:
- Resize to 1920px width minimum
- Use 85-90% quality
- Mention they're for printing in your email

### Screenshots and Text
For screenshots with text:
- Keep closer to original size
- Use PNG format (better for text)
- 85-90% quality

### Product Photos for Review
When sending product photos:
- 1200-1600px width
- 80-85% quality
- Multiple angles/views acceptable

## Cloud Storage Alternative

For large albums, consider:
- Google Photos (share link)
- Dropbox (shared folder)
- WeTransfer (up to 2GB free)
- iCloud Shared Albums

But for quick sharing of a few photos, resizing for email is still the fastest option.

## Quick Reference Guide
